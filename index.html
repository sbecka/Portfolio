                <h1>Hello there!</h1>
                <p>
                    I completed a full stack web development program at Bloc. 
                    I really enjoyed my learning experience as well as helping and sharing ideas with my peers. 
                    I love being able to use my creativity in designing websites.
                    I like problem solving and being able to exercise my skills with the many challenges I have encountered so far on my journey.
                    I also like joining teams to create new projects together and to pursue improving each other. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    My curiosity in coding began when I volunteered in a study as a requirement for my psychology lecture in university about three years ago. 
                    The study involved us learning how to code in JavaScript for beginners. 
                    After the study, I wanted to learn more because I love learning about how things work in our world. 
                    Then after university, I started to pick up coding again as I became interested in how hacking works and started to learn a little bit about Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I help volunteer teaching tennis or play tennis with friends. 
                    I’ve been playing tennis since I was very young and I can’t live without it. 
                    My other interests include: hiking, cooking, drawing, yoga, travel, and turtles.

                        I participated in my first hackathon with Mintbean! 
                        We had about 3-4 hours to make our own Markdown editors.
                        Any edits made in the editor can be viewed live.
                        The editor's background and font colors can be changed with different themes.
                        I learned about new libraries and had fun creating with React for this project.
                        I got to connect with new people and see everyone's projects at the end.

                        I was inspired by a friend and their family who have game nights every week.
                        I thought it would be nice to create an app for them to see their game scores and progress for each game they played.
                        I created this app for families and groups of friends who want to keep track of their game scores and results.
                        A user creates a group name to sign up and login with to save their scores and results.
                        A score sheet is made for new games and can be edited. 
                        Player names can be added and their scores can be edited and updated.
                        Each game will have their own statistics page of the player scores and can be deleted.

                        I love to travel, but I have trouble remembering all the things I did.
                        I wanted to have one place to keep all my thoughts and make my experiences more memorable instead of taking hundreds of pictures.
                        Therefore, I made this travel journal app for travelers and adventurers to write about any places they have been to and their current trips. 
                        A user can sign up and keep track of all their journal posts in their home page. 
                        Users can add, edit, or delete their journal posts. 
                        They can click on journal posts to read a journal page's content. 
                        The journal pages also have a comment section below the content for all users to make comments. 
                        The discover page allows users to read and comment on all the journal posts from all users of the app.

                        After traveling to Sedona, AZ, my love of hiking and being one with nature grew.
                        There aren't many hiking places where I live currently or at least that's what I thought.
                        After discovering the Hiking Project API, I found several trails in my area that I didn't know had existed!
                        Also, I realized I could help hikers figure out how long the sun would be out because you don't want to be lost when it gets dark.
                        I created this app to use the Hiking Project API along with other APIs to get hiking trails and sunrise and sunset times for any location.
                        Hikers and anyone exploring the world can search for trails in different cities or places to add to their to do list section. 
                        Users also choose a date to get sunrise and sunset times for that place. 
                        The sun times and the daytime's length will appear on the side of to do list section which the user can use as reference to plan out that day.

                        I always dress up as a witch because of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
                        Halloween was happening in a couple of weeks at the time of this project, and I knew I wanted to honor my favorite holiday. 
                        I created a fun Halloween trivia quiz for my friends and family to take and test their knowledge.
                        Users will get a response to the answers they choose and get their final score at the end of the quiz. 
                        Question number and user’s score is tracked at the top of the quiz. 
                        The quiz can be restarted if the user wants to retake the quiz.
                    </p>
